    <!-- Chosen Palette: Cool Slate -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is structured as a tabbed, single-page application (SPA) to provide a non-linear, user-friendly study experience. This dashboard-style layout allows users to easily switch between a high-level overview, detailed course notes, practical case studies, and an interactive Q&A section. This design was chosen over a simple long-scroll page to prevent information overload and empower users to focus on the specific areas they need to review, facilitating a more efficient and targeted learning process. The key interactions include tab-based navigation, expandable accordions for notes, and filterable, flippable flashcards for active recall. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Dashboard Overview: Report Info (Q&A question distribution) -> Goal (Provide an engaging entry point) -> Viz (Chart.js Doughnut Chart) -> Interaction (Hover to see details) -> Justification (Visually breaks down the review content's focus) -> Library (Chart.js/Canvas).
        - Core Concepts Review: Report Info (Detailed chapter notes) -> Goal (Present dense text in a digestible format) -> Presentation (HTML/CSS Accordion) -> Interaction (Click to expand/collapse sections) -> Justification (Prevents a "wall of text" and allows users to focus on one chapter at a time) -> Library/Method (Vanilla JS + Tailwind CSS).
        - Case Studies: Report Info (10 scenario-based problems) -> Goal (Allow focused study of practical applications) -> Presentation (Expandable list) -> Interaction (Click to reveal case details) -> Justification (Keeps the interface clean while making all cases easily accessible) -> Library/Method (Vanilla JS + Tailwind CSS).
        - Q&A Flashcards: Report Info (100 questions and answers) -> Goal (Facilitate active learning and self-testing) -> Presentation (Interactive card grid) -> Interaction (Click to "flip" card, filter by chapter) -> Justification (Transforms a static list into a powerful, engaging study tool that reinforces learning) -> Library/Method (Vanilla JS + Tailwind CSS).
